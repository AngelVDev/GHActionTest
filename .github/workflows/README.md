## Deleter.yml

This snippet is a section of a YAML file configuring a GitHub Actions workflow. This particular workflow is designed to delete a branch when a pull request to the main branch is closed, given the pull request has been merged and labeled 'delete branch'. Here's a breakdown:

- In the `on` section:
  - `pull_request` triggers this workflow whenever there's activity on pull requests.
  - `branches: [main]` restricts the trigger to pull requests that are intended for the main branch.
  - `types: [closed]` further filters to only execute the workflow when such pull requests are closed.

- In the `jobs` section:
  - `delete-branch` is the name assigned to this job workflow.
  - `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` runs the steps of the job on the latest Ubuntu virtual environment.
  - `if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'delete branch')` is a condition that ensures the job runs only when the pull request has been merged and it contains a label named 'delete branch'.
  
- In the `steps` section:
  - `- name: checkout` names the first step as 'checkout'.
  - `uses: actions/checkout@v4` checks out the repository's code using the 'checkout' GitHub action at version 4.
  - `with:` allows to pass parameters to the `checkout` action, where `token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` authenticates using a built-in GitHub token.
  
- In the next step, `- name: Delete branch` is the main deletion operation.
  - `run: | git push origin --delete $BRANCH_TO_DELETE` removes the branch from the remote repository by executing the command.
  - `env:` sets an environment variable for this command, where `BRANCH_TO_DELETE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}` sets the branch to be deleted as the branch from which the pull request originated.
